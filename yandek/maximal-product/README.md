Given a list filled with arbitrary integers. Find in this list two numbers whose product is maximal. Print these numbers in non-decreasing order.

The list contains at least two elements. The numbers are chosen so that the answer is unambiguous.

The solution should have complexity O(n) , where n is the size of the list.
